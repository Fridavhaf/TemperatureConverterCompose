# Temperature Converter App

A simple temperature converter built with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **MVVM architecture**.
The app demonstrates reactive UI, proper state management, and a clean separation between data, state, and UI.

## Usage
1. Enter a temperature in the text field.
2. Tap "To Celsius" or "To Fahrenheit" to see the converted result.
3. UI updates automatically based on the underlying state.
